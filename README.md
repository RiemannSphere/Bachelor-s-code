# Bachelor-s-code
Bachelor's code. 

This code is computing binary fraction in given globular clusters. 
Code applies a specific algorithm called further "photometric". It means that stars are treated as were seen by telescope.
For example:
 - binary stars are treated as one point
 - binary stars containing dim companion are treated as single stars
 - we are interested only in Main Sequence stars and their binary systems
 - etc.
It brings great tool for comparison between observations and real clusters.

To run the code you need to have model of cluster expecially luminosity, mass, color and stellar type of every single star. 

Work is still in progress. Code is pretty chaotic but you can check last results in PDF and EPS files.
